# Quick Video Notes - Glance While Recording

## 🎯 MAIN POINTS (Say These)

1. **What it does**: Sketch → Beautiful Image
2. **How**: Custom GAN (Generator + Discriminator)
3. **Architecture**: U-Net with skip connections
4. **Training**: Adversarial + L1 loss
5. **Results**: 53M params, 256x256 images
6. **Special**: Built from scratch, complete system

## 📝 SIMPLE SCRIPT (Read This)

### Opening
"Hi! I'm showing my sketch-to-image generation project - a custom GAN that transforms sketches into beautiful images."

### Technical
"The system has two networks: a U-Net generator that processes sketches, and a PatchGAN discriminator that evaluates realism. They train together adversarially."

### Demo
"Here's how it works - I give it a sketch, and it generates this detailed image. Notice how it preserves structure while adding colors."

### Highlights
"I built the entire architecture from scratch - 53 million parameters. It's a complete system with data generation, training, and inference."

### Closing
"This demonstrates my ability to design deep learning architectures and build end-to-end ML systems. Thanks!"
